                    <div class="panel-body">​
                        The tools I used to build this website are as follows:</p>

                        <p><strong>1. Bootstrap:</strong> I used Bootstrap to find an appropriate template from which I could create my website. By selecting a template with a nice format and appealing style, I was able to focus on the content of my website without needing to write code for the underlying website layout. <strong> </b> <span class="bold"> </span></p> </strong>

                      </p>
                      This approach is great for saving time and enables you to create a functional and attractive website without prior experience in html coding.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <p><strong>2. Atom:</strong> Atom is the text editor I used to create my website. The html code from Bootstrap was copied into Atom and all of the edits that I made to the template in order to create my own website were done in Atom. Saving my file in Atom and refreshing the webpage allowed me to view changes as I made them. <strong> </b> <span class="bold"> </span></p> </strong>


                  </p>

                  <br>
                  <br>

                  <p><strong>3. GitHub:</strong> I used GitHub Desktop in tandem with Atom to keep track of the changes I made to my website. Each time I made a major change, I added a new entry in GitHub with a brief description of the change. This allowed me to keep a record of the changes made, and revert any changes that introduced errors.</p> Using GitHub and Atom together is a very effective way of preventing bugs from disrupting your website. Even small changes to your code can make a huge difference to the way the website appears, and in GitHub, you can just revert the previous change as soon as you see a bug introduced. <strong> </b> <span class="bold"> </span></p> </strong>

                    <div class="panel-body">​
                       You just need to follow three simple steps in order to register and set-up a domain name:
                     </p>
                   </p>
                   </p>
                   <p style="font-size: 1.23em;">Step 1: Brainstorm ideas for your domain name.</p>
                 </p>
                   <p style="font-style: 400italic:;">Top Tip: Make it memorable, use words that are associated with your company, and avoid names that are similar to a competing company (you can check if a similar name has already been registered by visiting the Trademark Office's trademark database)

                 </p>
              <br>
               <p style="font-size: 1.23em;">Step 2: Pick the right top level domain (the extension that you see to the right of the '.')
               </p>
               </p>

               <p><strong>.com</strong> is a global top level domain and is still the most popular choice worldwide <strong> </b> <span class="bold"> </span></p> </strong>

               </p>

               <p><strong>.co.uk</strong> is the well established standard in the uk (the most popoular option for UK only websites) <strong> </b> <span class="bold"> </span></p> </strong>

               </p>

               <p><strong>.net</strong> now has approximately 15 million registrations so is a well established domain with growing popularity <strong> </b> <span class="bold"> </span></p> </strong>


             </p>
             <br>
           </p>
           <p style="font-size: 1.23em;">Step 3: Select a Registrar
           </p>

           You will need to choose a Registra to host your domain, and you will need to pay a small fee to the Registra to host your domain, and this will likely have to be payed annually to renew your website for another year.
         </p>

        There are numerous domain name Registras, but here is a list of a few well known ones that you can use:
      </p>
      </p>

    1. GoDaddy </p>
    2. 1&1 IONOS </p>
    3. Domain.com </p>

                      <li> Compatability - as more and more people use mobile devices and tablets to access the internet, it is essential that websites can be accessed easily on all devices. </li>​
                      <li> Accessibility to All Users - it is very important that a website is accessible to everyone, including people that are visually impaired, disabled, or elderly.   </li>​
                      <li> User Friendly - the website must be easy to use and quick to find information. If users cannot use your wensite with ease, they are likely to move to an alternative website. </li>​
                      <li> Clearly presented information - the way that information on a website is presented is a key requirement for good usability. Users must be able to find information easily and it must be disaplayed in a way that is easy to understand. </li>​
                      <li> Effective Navigation - it is crucial that the navigation menu is easy to use and it should not take long for users to navigate to the section that they desire. Large websites should make use of drop-down menus in order to avoid clutter in the naviagtion bar</li>​
                      <li> Browser Consistentcy - websites can be intepreted in differnt ways by different browsers so it is important that the website behaves consistently across all major browsers. </li>​
                      <li> Appealing Style and Format - websites need to be appealing in design to attract users to them, and this requires the use of a sleek style and appealing format. This includes things like making sure that paragraphs aren't too long and sufficient spacing is used between different sections. </li>
                    </p>
                      <li> High quality images - Images are the first thing that people look at on a website, so the use of high quality images can really boost the appeal of a website </li>​

                        In terms of Websites, accessiblility refers to the practise of making sure that no barriers exist to prevent people with disabilities from interacting with or obtaining access to websites.
                        Standard guidelines can be followed to ensure that websites are designed and developed in a way that means that all users (in general) have equal access to information and functionality.
                      </p>
                      <p><strong>Below are the suggested guidelines for ensuring website accessibility:</strong> <strong> </b> <span class="bold"> </span></p> </strong>

                    </p>
                    1. Alternative Text for Images: All images should include equivalent text (alt text) which briefly describe the photo. This means that people who are visually impaired, can for example, understand the image by using a screen reader that reads alound information on the webpage.
                  </p>
                    2. Keyboard Input: Some people are unable to use a mouse, so an accessible website must not rely on use of a mouse. All functionality must be available from a keyboard, allowing people with disabilities to use assistive technologies that mimick a keyboard, like speech input for example.
                  </p>
                  3. Transcripts for Audio: Audio files are unavailable for people that cannot hear, so providing a text transcript of the audio file means that audio information is accessible to people who are deaf or are hard of hearing.

                </p>
                4. Content does not cause seizures: Web contect that flashes at certain rates or in certain patterns can cause seizures or other photosensitive reactions. Therefore, flashing content is ideally avoided completely or implemented in a way that does not cause photosensitive reactions (e.g. by adapting flashing pattern or rate).

                         The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the EU and the European Economic Area. The GDPR contains information and regulation concerning the protection of personal data and how it is used by organisations, and its aim is to give individuals control over their personal data.
                       </p>
                       <p><strong>The rights of individuals using your website under GDPR are outlined below:</strong> <strong> </b> <span class="bold"> </span></p> </strong>
                       <br>
                       1. Consent: Under GDPR, the conditions for data consent have been strengthed, and companies are no longer able to use long and illegible terms and conditions containing excessive kegalese. The request for consent must be provided in an easily accessible form, and the purpose for personel data processing must be attached to that consent. It must also be as easy to withdraw consent as it is to give it.
                   </p>
                   2. Breach Notfication: Breach notifications are mandatory where a data breach is likely to "result in a risk for the rights and freedoms of individuals". The breach notification must be generated within 72 hours of first having become aware of a breach. Data processors are required to notify their customers (the controllers) “without undue delay” after first becoming aware of a breach.
                 </p>
                 3. Right to Access: Individuals have the right to obtain confirmation from the data controller as to whether or not their personal data has been processed, where it has been processed and for what purpose. In fact, the contoller should provide a copy without charge of the personal data, in electronic format.
               </p>
                 4. Right to be Forgotten: Individuals have the right to request the data controller to erase their personal data, cease further circulation of the data and (potentially) request third parties cease processing of the personal data.
               </p>
               5. Data Portability: Individuals can receive the personal data concerning them and have the right to trasnfer that data to another controller.

            <p><strong>Useful tips for making your website GDPR compliant:</strong> <strong> </b> <span class="bold"> </span></p> </strong>
 </p>

            1. Active opt-in forms: Make sure that any forms that invite users to provide contact details for marketing purposes should default to 'no' or be blank.
          </p>
          2. Unbundled opt-in: The consent that you ask for must be set out in seperate questions for accepting terms and conditions, and for accepting the use of data in other ways (e.g. marketing)
        </p>
        3. Make it clear on your website that users have the permisssion to withdraw permission should they want to, and make this an easy process to follow.
      </p>
      4. Ensure your website clearly identifies ALL parties for which consent for which consent is being granted.

                          <p><strong>Effective marketing is crucial in encouraging your target market to visit your website. Outlined below are the main marketing steps that I would take to drive traffic to my website:</strong> <strong> </b> <span class="bold"> </span></p> </strong>
                        <br>
                        1. Social Media: Take advantage of social media by advertising my website across a range of different social media platforms
                      </p>
                      2. Use Search Engine Optimisation (SEO): This considers how search engines work, and algorithms dictate search engine behavior, such as what people search for and keywords that are searched. I would use this internet marketing strategy to optimise my website content and keywords to make it as relevent as possible for those in our target market.

                    </p>
                      3. Google reviews: I would encourage customers to leave reviews for our product which could be included on google searches.
                    </p>
                    4. 3rd Party Sites: Include links to my website on all online shopping sites that the product is advertised on. This means that customers who find our product through a 3rd party shopping site will still be encouraged to visit the main site.
                  </p>
                  5. Email Marketing: Require that customers 'sign up' to purchase something, which if they consent, would allow us to send out marketing emails advertising our product and website.

                        1. Add more information to the 'product' section of the website with more images to give customers a full understanding of the features avaialble
                      </p>
                      2. Add functionality to actually purchase our product direct from the website
                    </p>
                    3. Integrate secure and reliable payment methods such as paypal so that we are insured against potential scams
                  </p>
                  4. Add a page where users can upload their own designs for football players, which we will produce and sell based on popularity (get users to vote)
                </p>
                5. Add a forum page where potential customers can ask questions about the product and current users can share their tips and tricks for the best tactical setups
